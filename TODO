TODO

- Use a tree for the object inspector in order to show an object's children of the Object or list[Object] type
- Update the selected object's attribute values every frame
- Allow selecting an object by clicking on it on canvas (this behavior should be configurable via a toggle on the interface)
- When calling a method or setting an attribute using the UI, potential exceptions should be shown on history
- Release mode: run(globals(), release=true) should open the application showing only the canvas
- Create class ImageData to encapsulate a PIL Image
- Show object id in hexadecimal
