TODO

- Fix destroy() (currently doesn't work)
- Remove padding of canvas
- Update the selected object's attribute values every frame
- When calling a method or setting an attribute using the UI, potential exceptions should be shown on history
- Release mode: run(globals(), release=true) should open the application showing only the canvas
- Create class ImageData to encapsulate a PIL Image (to improve performance of animations)
- Selection of an object by clicking on it on canvas is a behavior that should be configurable via a toggle on the interface
- Add button to reload script
- Add button to open script from file
- On Windows, dialogs shown after first one do not get focus
- Use tk.Frame or tk.Canvas for BaseComposite
- Add toggle to see private members

Old

- Maybe use decorator to identify tupy objects (instead of inheritance)
  - Tried it, it didn't work
