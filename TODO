TODO

- Turn object pane into an object browser; clicking on a button to navigate, and elsewhere to select
- Update the selected object's attribute values every frame
- When calling a method or setting an attribute using the UI, potential exceptions should be shown on history
- Release mode: run(globals(), release=true) should open the application showing only the canvas
- Create class ImageData to encapsulate a PIL Image (to improve performance of animations)
- Selection of an object by clicking on it on canvas is a behavior that should be configurable via a toggle on the interface
